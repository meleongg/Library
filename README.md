# Library

## Purpose
After writing my first React application, I realized that my JS needed some work, so I reviewed how to work with JS Objects with this project! This Library application allows users to add and delete books to the bookshelf via form inputs.

## What I learned
- How to access user input from a modal form
- Object constructor syntax
- Prototypal inheritance model 
- Using dataset attributes to uniquely identify important elements
